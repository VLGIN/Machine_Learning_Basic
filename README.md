# Machine_Learning_Basic
This repository includes basic machine learning algorithms code:
# Decision Tree:
I implement decision tree with ID3 algorithms for credit score problem.

Folder Decision Tree contains two csv files, the first one is bank.csv - original dataset for this problem and the second one is train.csv is processed dataset.

In decisiontree.ipynb, i seperate dataset into train and test set with the ratio of 8:2.

I calculate accuracy and f1_score to evaluate result of model.

# Naive Bayes:
Naive Bayes algorithm in folder Naive_Bayes is used to predict group of age based on clubs a person taking part in.

The dataset is stored in Naive_Bayes/agedetector_group_train.v1.0.txt and the test set is Naive_Bayes/test.txt.

# K-means:
I use K-means for clustering texts with tf-idf feature-extraction.

Dataset and code is stored in foler K_means.
